# 486-project
Semester project for STAT 486. Using machine learning to analyze song information from Spotify.


## Project Requirements:

## Tier 1 (highest level of engagement)
Data: Moderately complex to complex (satisfies several of the following)

~1000 or more instance

Many features of varying types

Non-tabular data

Some processing and cleaning

Analysis: The project should include at least FIVE of the following:
* Significant or innovative feature engineering
* Implementation of at least two standard supervised machine learning models without extensive
hyperparameter tuning
* Implementation of 2-4 advanced supervised machine learning methods with detailed
* hyperparameter tuning
* Cluster analysis and/or anomaly detection
* Use of another unsupervised learning method, such as meaningful dimension reduction, apriori or
recommender systems
* An exploration of variable importance using an explainable AI method (e.g., SHAP, LIME)
* Use of a significant ML method we didn't learn in class

Feedback & Iteration:
*After EDA, specifically ask peer reviewers:
*Are there any aspects that you didn't explore?
*After analysis step, specifically ask peer reviewers:
*Is there anything that is incorrect?
*Are there other models or methods that could be considered?
*On final report, specifically ask peer reviewers:
*Is anything unclear, too wordy/detailing, too vague?
*Are there any obvious typos or formatting issues?

Deliverables:
*GitHub Repo:
*A web application, dashboard or blog post
